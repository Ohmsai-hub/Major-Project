# Major-Project
The Bank Account Management System in C is a menu-driven program that allows users to register, log in, and manage their bank accounts securely. The system performs key operations such as deposit, withdrawal, balance check, and viewing transaction history, and all data is stored permanently in a readable text file (bank.txt).

The project uses multiple header files such as stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, time.h, and ctype.h for handling input/output, memory, strings, timestamps, and validations.
It also demonstrates the use of structures, functions, file handling, conditional statements, loops, arrays, and modular programming, making it a complete and well-rounded C project.
